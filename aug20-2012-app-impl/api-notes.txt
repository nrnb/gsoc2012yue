Get App Status
==============

URL
---

GET  http://127.0.0.1:2608/status?appname=<app_name>

Notes: App_name is the full app name. For web-downloaded apps, it will be the same 
as the Cytoscape-App-Name entry in the manifest.

Response
--------

{
 "request_name": The app name requested by the app store
 "status": installed, uninstall-on-restart, uninstalled, or not-found. Not found would 
mean the app isn't found on the user's computer.
 "version": The version of the app, as found in the Cytoscape-App-Version manifest entry,
or "not-found" if not available. It will also be "not-found" in the case that the app was
not found on the user's computer.
}

Install an App
==============

URL
---

GET  http://127.0.0.1:2608/install?appname=<app_name>&version=<version>

Response
--------

The server attempts to query the app from the app store. If no matches were found 
for the version, or if the version information was absent, an error is returned in
the "install_status" field.

Upon completion, the server sends the following:

{
 "app_name": The name of the install app
 "install_status": The result of the installation. Values could be: success, 
app-not-found, version-not-found, install-failed. "install-failed" is for when an app
matching the given name and version was found, but there was an error while attempting
to install it, such as a malformed manifest, or some other error preventing successful
install.
 "install_error": If install outcome was something other than success, then a more
detailed message is put here.
}
